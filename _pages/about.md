Hi! I am currently a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Google Research, advised by [Dr. Partha Talukdar](https://parthatalukdar.github.io). My broader research interests lie in leveraging multimodality for improving Large Language Models. At Google, I am exploring ways to tackle text-data sparsity for low-resource languages with the more readily available speech data.

Prior to my tenure at Google, I pursued my Master's (Research) at Indian Institue of Science, Bangalore. During my academic journey I worked on semantic parsing and source code modeling, advised by [Dr. Shirish Shevade](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/shirish-k-shevade/). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from BITS. Before pivoting to machine learning, I spent a summer exploring asynchronous systems with [Dr. Akash Lal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/akashl/) at Microsoft Research.

Besides my academic pursuits, I also find joy in playing snooker and freestyle football (soccer). I am always up for new collaborations! Feel free to drop me an email if you want to connect. :)
