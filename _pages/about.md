Hi! I am currently a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Google Research, advised by [Dr. Partha Talukdar](https://parthatalukdar.github.io). My primary research interests lie in leveraging multimodality for improving Large Language Models. At Google, I am exploring ways to tackle text-data sparsity for extremely low-resource languages using speech modality. I am also fortunate to closely collaborate with [Dr. Sriram Ganapathy](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram-ganapathy/) and [Dr. Shikhar Vashishth](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=gXW8J2wAAAAJ&hl=en) at Google.

Prior to my tenure at Google, I pursued my Master's (Research) at the Indian Institue of Science. During my academic journey I worked on semantic parsing and source code modeling, advised by [Dr. Shirish Shevade](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/shirish-k-shevade/). Then, I spent some time working on source code understanding models with [Dr. Aditya Kanade](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kanadeaditya/) and Dr. Shevade. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from BITS. Before pivoting to machine learning, I also spent a summer exploring asynchronous systems with [Dr. Akash Lal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/akashl/) at Microsoft Research.

Besides my academic pursuits, I find joy in playing snooker and freestyle football (soccer). 

For more information please refer to my [CV](https://shikhar-s.github.io/files/CV_20231214.pdf) and [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pbU47_MAAAAJ&hl=en).
I am always up for new collaborations! Feel free to reach out via email if you'd like to connect. :)
