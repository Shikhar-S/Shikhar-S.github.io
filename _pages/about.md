H! I am currently a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Google Research, actively working with [Dr. Partha Talukdar](https://parthatalukdar.github.io) in the Languages group. My primary research interests lie in the understanding and development of Large Multimodal Language Models.

Prior to my tenure at Google, I pursued my Master's (by Research) at IISc, Bangalore. During my academic journey, I was mentored by [Dr. Shirish Shevade](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/shirish-k-shevade/) and [Dr. Aditya Kanade](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kanadeaditya/), applying NLP techniques to enhance source code comprehension and generation.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from BITS, after which I gained practical experience as a Software Developer at MediaNet for a year.

Besides my academic pursuits, I also find joy in playing snooker and freestyle football (soccer).
