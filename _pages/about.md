H! I am currently a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Google Research, actively working with Dr. Partha Talukdar within the Languages group. My primary research interests lie in the understanding and development of Large Multimodal Language Models.

Prior to my tenure at Google, I pursued my Master's (by Research) at IISc, Bangalore. During my academic journey, I had the privilege of working alongside Dr. Shirish Shevade and Dr. Aditya Kanade, applying NLP techniques to enhance source code comprehension and generation.

The overarching goal of my research is to contribute to the creation of more accessible and inclusive language technologies. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from BITS, after which I gained practical experience as a Software Developer at MediaNet for a year.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I find joy in playing snooker and football, and I actively engage in competitive programming.
