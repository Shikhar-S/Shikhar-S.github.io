I am a research student at the Indian Institute of Science. Through my research, I am trying to make programming accessible to all by applying Natural Language Processing techniques to source code. 

Earlier I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology. Then I worked at Media net as a Software developer for one year.

My academic interests include Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Computational Geometry and Algorithms.

I enjoy playing snooker and football, and competitive programming.
