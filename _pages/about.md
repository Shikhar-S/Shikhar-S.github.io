Hi! I’m a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, fortunate to be advised by [Prof Shinji Watanabe](https://sites.google.com/view/shinjiwatanabe/). My research focuses on self-supervised learning for audio and multimodal alignment. I’m especially interested in using sound to provide complete context for speech language models.

Previously, I was a pre-doctoral researcher at Google DeepMind, working on low-resource language capabilities for [Gemini](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06261) with [Dr. Partha Talukdar](https://parthatalukdar.github.io), [Dr. Sriram Ganapathy](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram-ganapathy/) and [Dr. Shikhar Vashishth](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=gXW8J2wAAAAJ&hl=en).

For more information please refer to my [CV](https://shikhar-s.github.io/files/CV_20231214.pdf) and [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pbU47_MAAAAJ&hl=en).

Besides my research, I find joy in playing snooker and freestyle football (soccer).
I’m always open to collaborations, feel free to reach out!
