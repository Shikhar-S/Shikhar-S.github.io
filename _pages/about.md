Hi! I am a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Google Research working with Dr. Partha Talukdar in the Languages group.
I am interested in multimodal NLP and in understanding and developing Large Multimodal Language Models.
Before joining Google, I did my Masters (by Research) at IISc, Bangalore and Bachelors from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad.
There I worked with Dr. Shirish Shevade and Dr. Aditya Kanade by applying NLP techniques to source code. 
My research goal is to make more accessible and inclusive language technologies.
I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science Engineering from BITS.
Then I worked at Media net as a Software developer for one year.
I enjoy playing snooker and football, and competitive programming.
